## 📘 Introduction

The Oracle Database project tasks you with designing an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram and implementing a relational schema using SQL scripts. The database models core social media features, including users, friendships, messages, photos, albums, events, and more. The schema and constraints must strictly follow the requirements and structure provided in the project specification.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `ER_Diagram.pdf` — ER diagram for the plaform database.
- `createTables.sql` — SQL script to create all tables, constraints, sequences, and triggers as required by the specification.
- `dropTables.sql` — SQL script to drop all database objects created by `createTables.sql`.
- `README.md` — Project documentation (this file).

Additional files (e.g., test scripts or documentation) may be included as needed.
